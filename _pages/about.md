Welcome! I am a junior at Texas A&M University studying Robotics and Controls Engineering with a passion for multi-agent robotic systems. My passion lies in swarm robotics, particularly in the fields of collaborative autonomy and multi-agent systems. I have worked heavily in aerial autonomy, with an emphasis on spatial awareness and disaster response. With expertise in C++, SolidWorks, and machine learning, I strive to bring autonomous systems closer to real-world applications by developing reliable, scalable solutions that enable robots to operate autonomously in complex, dynamic environments. Through my experiences in both research and hands-on projects, I aim to push the boundaries of aerial autonomy, contributing to next advancements of the 21st century.


 
### Research Interests  
<!-- multi agent systems, swarm robotics, drone navigation, aerial autonomy, and collaborative development -->
 - **Swarm Control of UAVs:** Developing exploration and mapping algorithms to enable multi-agent collaboration in GPS/GNSS-Denied settings.
 - **Controls of Vertical Takeoff & Landing (VTOL) Systems:** Investigating and optimizing robust controllers for VTOL aircraft and Aerial Manipulators.
 - **Unmanned Navigation Systems:** Advancing localization and mapping technologies utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting and Machine Learning (ML) based Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with broad spectrum sensors (Infrared and Ultraviolet).
 - **Autonomous Systems Modeling and Simulation:** Exploring novel implementations of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technologies to lower processing requirements, including real-time performance improvements and hybrid techniques integrating sensor fusion.
