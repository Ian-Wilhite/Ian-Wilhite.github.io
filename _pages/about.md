## About Me  
Welcome! I am a junior at Texas A&M University studying mechanical engineering with a deep passion for robotics, multi-agent systems, and their applications in real-world problem-solving. My academic and professional journey has been shaped by a drive to innovate in the fields of swarm intelligence, autonomous systems, and disaster response technology.  

### Research Interests  
üî¨ My research focuses on advancing the capabilities of multi-agent systems, particularly in robotics. I'm passionate about the development of swarm robotics for applications such as wildfire monitoring, disaster response, and exploration. These systems require intricate coordination and control algorithms to solve complex, real-time problems in dynamic environments.  

üìö Currently, I am working on projects involving drone swarms designed for wildfire hotspot identification and Mars rover simulations aimed at optimizing mobility on challenging terrain. These projects are giving me valuable experience in the practical challenges of autonomous systems in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial contexts.

### Ongoing Projects  
üöÅ **Disaster Response Observation Network (D.R.O.N.)**  
As the Project Lead & Founder, I‚Äôm leading a team to design a fleet of drones capable of assisting first responders during wildfire emergencies. My role includes overseeing the design of the drone systems, managing project timelines, writing technical documentation, and mentoring new team members.  

üåç **Mars Rover Simulation (MEEN 357)**  
For my engineering course, I am building and analyzing a rover simulation that models forces acting on a Mars rover, integrating telemetry data to track its velocity, position, and power consumption. This project is helping me develop skills in simulation software, data analysis, and modeling, while also deepening my understanding of planetary exploration.  

### Previous Experience  
üõ†Ô∏è **Philmont Staff Association**  
During my time at Philmont Scout Ranch, I had the opportunity to work in various engineering and leadership roles, which strengthened my problem-solving skills and ability to work under pressure. I applied my technical skills to create solutions in high-stakes environments and led teams through complex logistical challenges.  

### Future Goals  
üöÄ Looking ahead, I am excited to expand my expertise in robotics and multi-agent systems to address a variety of pressing global challenges. My goal is to continue working on innovative projects that push the boundaries of autonomous systems, including applications in search-and-rescue operations, sustainable environmental monitoring, and extraterrestrial exploration.  

üåê In the future, I aim to contribute to the development of robotics technologies that can operate autonomously in harsh environments, making a meaningful impact on industries such as disaster relief, environmental conservation, and space exploration.
