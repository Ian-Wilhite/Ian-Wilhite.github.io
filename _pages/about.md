Welcome! I am a junior at Texas A&M University studying Robotics and Controls Engineering with a passion for multi-agent robotic systems.

### Research Interests  

 - **Swarm Control of UAVs:** Developing exploration and mapping algorithms to enable multi-agent collaboration in GPS/GNSS-Denied settings.
 - **Controls of Vertical Takeoff & Landing (VTOL) Systems:** Investigating and optimizing robust controllers for VTOL aircraft and Aerial Manipulators.
 - **Unmanned Navigation Systems:** Advancing localization and mapping technologies utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting and Machine Learning (ML) based Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with broad spectrum sensors (Infrared and Ultraviolet).
 - **Autonomous Systems Modeling and Simulation:** Exploring novel implementations of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technologies to lower processing requirements, including real-time performance improvements and hybrid techniques integrating sensor fusion.
