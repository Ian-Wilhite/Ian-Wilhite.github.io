Welcome! I am a junior at Texas A&M University studying Robotics and Controls Engineering with a passion for multi-agent robotic systems.

### Research Interests  
ðŸ”¬ My research focuses on advancing the capabilities of multi-agent systems, particularly in robotics. I'm passionate about the development of swarm robotics for applications such as wildfire monitoring, disaster response, and exploration. These systems require intricate coordination and control algorithms to solve complex, real-time problems in dynamic environments.  

ðŸ“š Currently, I am working on projects involving drone swarms designed for wildfire hotspot identification and Mars rover simulations aimed at optimizing mobility on challenging terrain. These projects are giving me valuable experience in the practical challenges of autonomous systems in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial contexts.

### Future Goals  
ðŸš€ Looking ahead, I am excited to expand my expertise in robotics and multi-agent systems to address a variety of pressing global challenges. My goal is to continue working on innovative projects that push the boundaries of autonomous systems, including applications in search-and-rescue operations, sustainable environmental monitoring, and extraterrestrial exploration.
