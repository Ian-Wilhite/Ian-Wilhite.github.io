**Date:** Nov. 2024
**Summary:** We designed an algorithm to play the New York Times Connections game using a word vectorization Machine Learning model. I can't wait to learn more about machine learning in the future. Even though we didn't place, I enjoyed the weekend building a working product and learning the underlying technologies.
