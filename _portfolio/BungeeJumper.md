**Summary:** For a Numerical Methods course (MEEN 357), we were tasked with designing a rover to quickly navigate a mars terrain by optimizing 9 parameters with 5 constraints and a time to optimize. In a timed race on randomized terrain, out of 28 teams, we placed 4th. This was an incredible problem to dive into and I'm proud of the product we delivered.
