**Summary:** The DRON Project is a tool designed to aid first responders in their response to structural fires by collecting and providing key data on the hotspots within the structure. The goal of the project is to create a swarm of drones equipped with photogrametric RGB cameras and infrared cameras, capable of autonomously navigating a complex environment and reporting on the active development of the fire.
